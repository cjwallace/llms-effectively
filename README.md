# Using LLM APIs Effectively

WIP.

[Effect](https://effect.website/) seems to provide a structured way of doing things we need to do anyway when working with external APIs.
Here I explore that specifically for LLM APIs.

## Use
1. Have deno installed. 
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a valid key.
3. Run with:
    ```zsh
    deno run --allow-env --allow-net main.ts
    ```
